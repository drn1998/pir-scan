# pir-scan
pir-scan is a tool to create a PIR-friendly index of a collection of text files. It can also use PIR codes, stemming etc. to make the search easier and reduce the size of otherwise impractical indexes.
Comprehensive documentation, which is neccessary to use this tool, will follow when I finished this program.
